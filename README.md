# Reverse Time Dilation Simulation 

This project is something I simply made when I got bored just wanted to test the matplotlib library so I decided to simulate the time dilation effects as predicted by Einstein's Theory of Special Relativity. 
The simulation shows how time slows down for an observer moving at speeds close to the speed of light.

## Requirements

- Well you need Python 3.x obviously
- `numpy` library
- `matplotlib` library
These two modules are must and u need to install it for the code to work

So here is a quick explanation for what exactly this is
As you can see the gamma variable here is the formula for which we can find the Time dialation Factor which is plotted in the Y side of that graph
v is velocity in which the speed is calculated and for c is just the speed of light
So as you know when an object moves closer to the speed of light then the time would start to slow down meaning time for the moving object (as seen by an observer at rest) will pass slower
Note the fact that object must move closer to the speed of light so that the time dilation becomes more significant and noticeable.
Anyways just run the code it's not much but just a graph so don't expect too much from it.
